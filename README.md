# Getting started on creating virtual machines from generalized image or specialized VHD in C# #

 Azure Compute sample for managing virtual machines -
  - Create a virtual machine
  - Deallocate the virtual machine
  - Generalize the virtual machine
  - Capture the virtual machine to create a generalized image
  - Create a second virtual machine using the generalized image
  - Delete the second virtual machine
  - Create a new virtual machine by attaching OS disk of deleted VM to it.


## Running this Sample ##

To run this sample:

Set the environment variable `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` with the full path for an auth file. See [how to create an auth file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-libraries-for-net/blob/master/AUTH.md).

    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-dotnet-create-virtual-machines-from-generalized-image-or-specialized-vhd.git

    cd compute-dotnet-create-virtual-machines-from-generalized-image-or-specialized-vhd

    dotnet build

    bin\Debug\net452\CreateVMsUsingCustomImageOrSpecializedVHD.exe
